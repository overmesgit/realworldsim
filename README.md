## Real world sim
I wanted to experiment with some new libraries like htmx and thought that building applications with it would be a great way to learn.
I didn't want to create just another blog site as it would be too dull. Instead, I thought of creating something that resembled a game because it would be more engaging and interesting.

This repository has a user action simulator and visualizer. Seeing your progress can make the writing exercise program more appealing.

The current implementation includes these actions:
* open the main site
* open the main site and count the number of articles
* open the main site and open a random article
* sign up / sign in
* write a new article

## UI example:

Each stage has a corresponding building that represents progress. 
Below each building, you can see users' interactions which are represented by user icons.
A list of all interactions is visible at the bottom of the page.
